# WeatheApp

## Description

I am wanting to push my skills further  to learn server side API. Therefore I challenged myself to take on a weather app. It solves one's curiosity of weather in a different state in the US. I learned so much even though my time crunch was so short. I figured out how to loop through data and use math to extract the exact days that needed to be displayed.
